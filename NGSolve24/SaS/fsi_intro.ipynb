This works only for small deformations as the triangles might get pressed through others leading to a break-down. Thus, we will penalize the volume compression on the one hand and play around with a space dependent function to manipulate the stiffness of the problem, which yields a nonlinear elasticity problem with the material law of Neo-Hook\n",
