    "If one spatial dimension of a domain $\\Omega=[0,1]^2\\times[-t/2,t/2]$ is small compared to the other directions, $t \\ll 1$, we have the following options\n",

    "The first option is inefficient as we would waste a lot of elements. The second option can easily lead to locking problems if the thickness $t$ is small. Therefore, the third option is commonly considered, where the 3D elasticity problem is reduced to a two-dimensional plate problem.\n",

    "If two directions are small compared to the third one, we can apply a dimension reduction to one-dimensional beams.\n",

    "In this chapter we first derive the Reissner-Mindlin and Kirchhoff-Love plate equations. Then, we present the Timschenko and Euler-Bernoulli beam and discuss the arising problems of shear locking or how to handle a fourth order problem as a mixed problem. After this, locking-free and stable formulations of the Kirchhoff-Love plate via Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson (HHJ) elements and Reissner-Mindlin plates with the tangential-displacement-normal-normal-stress continuous (TDNNS) elements are considered:\n",
