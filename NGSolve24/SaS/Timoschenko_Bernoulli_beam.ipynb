    "# Timoschenko and Euler-Bernoulli beam\n",
    "In this section we consider the Timoschenko and Euler-Bernoulli beam equations. If we have a structure $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ where one dimension is significantly thinner than the other a dimension reduction to a one-dimensional problem can be done. For example, $\\Omega = (0,1)\\times (-t/2,t/2)$ to the midsurface $\\mathcal{S}=(0,1)$. For the (linear) elasticity problem on $\\Omega$ the Timoschenko and Euler-Bernoulli beam are two frequently used models. We start with the Timoschenko beam.\n",

    "The Timoschenko beam includes the vertical deflection of the beam and rotational degrees of freedom. The corresponding energy reads\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term corresponds to the bending energy of the beam ($\\beta^\\prime=u^{\\prime\\prime}$ is the linearized curvature of the beam) and the second is the shear energy measuring the deviation of the rotation $\\beta$ to the linearized rotated normal vector of the beam. Here, $\\kappa=5/6$ and $G=E/(2(1+\\nu))$ denote the shear correction factor and shearing modulus, respectively, and $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We clamp the left side of the beam and define $H^1_{\\Gamma}((0,1))=\\{v\\in H^1((0,1))\\,\\vert\\, v(0)=0\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the variations of the energy we obtain the problem: For given force $f$ find $(u,\\beta)\\in H^1_{\\Gamma}((0,1))\\times H^1_{\\Gamma}((0,1))$ such that for all $(\\delta u,\\delta\\beta)\\in H^1_{\\Gamma}((0,1))\\times H^1_{\\Gamma}((0,1))$ \n",

    "A straight forward discretization approach is to use Lagrangian finite elements of the same order for the displacement and rotation $u_h,\\beta_h\\in V_h^k\\times V_h^k$, which is known to induce locking for small thickness parameters $t$. In the limit $t\\to 0$ the shearing energy can be seen as a penalty enforcing $u_h^\\prime=\\beta_h$. In the lowest order case this equation forces the piecewise constant $u^\\prime_h$ to fit with the linear and continuous $\\beta_h$ leading to the trivial solution, $u_h=0$. This situation is called shear locking. The constants in Cea's Lemma are not uniform in the thickness parameter. One can show that if the mesh size $h$ is of the order of the thickness $t$, the correct convergence rates start. From the theory of mixed methods we know that inserting on $L^2$-projection into the shearing term cures this problem be relaxing the constraint. In 1D this is equivalent to a numerical under-integration using only the mid-point rule for the shearing term. One can also proof that for at least quadratic order $k=2$ no shear locking occurs for the Timoschenko beam. (Note, that this is not true for plates.)"
