It allows you  to immediately deploy your notebooks in a live computing environment without even installing ngsolve."

This is made possible by compiling NGSolve into a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) code (supported by most major modern browsers). It is then offered to you using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) and [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)."
